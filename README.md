# iTunes.jr

Introduction
------------
This project implements a media manager that mimics `iTunes`. The tool allows Mp3 files to added to song library and playlists created with those songs. It offers different features such as removing songs, creating playlists with songs and other feautres. Songs can only be added via drag and drop, and other information such as title, artist, album etc. is extracted from the Mp3 header via `ID3v tags`. The library used is [mp3agic](https://github.com/mpatric/mp3agic) by Michael Patricios (Copyright (c) 2006-2017).
